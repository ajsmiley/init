Problem: Get the complete path of the file that contains the IP address of the DNS server you're using.

Solution: Host files are contained in the /ect file directories. Once we've traveled into there we can find the file resolv.conf. using <cat> we can find the IP

TLDR:
File path: /ect
File: resolv.conf
